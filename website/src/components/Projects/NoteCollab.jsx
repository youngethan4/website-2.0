            Note Collab is a project that started out as a school project and
            was evolved to a far greater point afterward for fun. The app is
            geared towards idea generation sessions for designers and engineers
            as well as throughout the Agile process. In a nutshell, the teams
            can create sticky notes and collaborate with one another as they
            would on a whiteboard. During the initial development in class, I
            had a partner that was working on the front-end while I worked on
            the back-end. However, towards the end, after many tries of trying
            to get him to learn and understand React, I had to take over as a
            full-stack developer to finish the project on time.
